# Release History

## v0.2.1 — April 25, 2026

**Performance recovery for small models.** Decode throughput on models with fewer KV heads (0.8B, 2B, 35B-A3B) was 40-60% slower than expected due to an overly aggressive GPU sync barrier. This release replaces it with a lightweight alternative, bringing decode speed back to within 10-17% of uncompressed baseline.

- Faster TurboQuant+ decode on small models (0.8B, 2B, 35B-A3B)
- TurboQuant+ support for NemotronH hybrid models
- Fixed a bug where compressed KV cache slots were being overwritten instead of appended
- Install script fixes for machines without MLX Python installed

## v0.2.0 — April 24, 2026

**KV cache compression and Homebrew install.** TurboQuant+ compresses the KV cache 3-5x with no measurable impact on output quality, enabling longer conversations on memory-constrained devices. Homebrew bottle means no Swift toolchain needed.

- TurboQuant+ KV cache compression (`--additional-config '{"kv_scheme": "turbo4v2"}'`)
- `brew install vllm-swift` with prebuilt bottle
- `vllm-swift update` command
- Decode and prompt logprobs
- Experimental vision-language model support

## v0.1.0 — April 22, 2026

**Initial release.** Native Swift/Metal inference backend for vLLM on Apple Silicon. Up to 2.6x faster decode than Python/MLX at low concurrency by removing Python from the inference hot path.

- OpenAI-compatible API server
- Batched concurrent decode
- Streaming responses
- Auto model download from HuggingFace
